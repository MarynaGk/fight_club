The Company has two directors who are passionately disagreeing, they want to fight it out.
Being the fantastic human that you are, you propose creating a virtual fight to minimise physical
harm.
You need to create a simple fighting game, where two opponents will fight until one of them
loses.
Hints: start by creating a Player class (the instance variables could be name, health, and power,
and weapon impact level).
You’ll need a few methods, consider one that keeps track of whether a player is alive, another
one that calculates the impact of hits (decreases the opponents health by the amount of the
other players power). And a third that outputs the players information.
You’ll then need to make a fight method that uses a loop to make the players hit one another
until the alive method returns false for one of them. When the loop is finished (which would
mean one of the players has lost), show the leaderboard of the players results.
Then create two Player objects (consider creating a random value for each player’s health and
power, where the maximum health value for a player is say 200, and the maximum power value
is 25) and call the fight method.
